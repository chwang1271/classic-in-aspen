			<div class="faq-response">
            	<p>Typical Aspen attire is casual during the day (i.e. jeans, shorts, polo shirts, sundresses, sneakers, sandals, etc.). At night you may want to wear something a little dressier, and please bring a sweater or jacket. It can be quite cool in the evenings so your best bet is to wear a couple of layers. The Grand Tasting Pavilion and many of the seminars are on a grassy surface, so please plan footwear accordingly. Just in case you forget anything, Aspen is full of great shops.</p>

    <div class="faq-question">
            <h3>How do I prepare for the altitude?</h3>
			<div class="faq-response">
            	<p>The high altitude of the Rockies affects everyone to a certain degree. You may find yourself a little short of breath or slightly more fatigued than usual. Please bring sunscreen and/or a hat since the sun’s rays are stronger at the higher altitude. It is wise to drink plenty of water when you arrive in Aspen until your body has adjusted. (We suggest at least 8 glasses of water a day to balance the great wine and spirits you’ll be sampling!)</p>
