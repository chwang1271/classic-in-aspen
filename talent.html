What began with Rocco's Organic Protein Powder Plus has since grown into a collection of better-for-you snacks and meals including chocolate bars, trail mix, Rocco's hazelnut spread, organic high-protein shakes, shake powder and more.</p>

          <p>In September 2017, he was hailed the champion of the hit series Guy's Grocery Games: Superstars on Food Network where he won $40,000 for charity, playing on behalf of HealthCorps.
